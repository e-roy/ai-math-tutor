### Phase 13 — Conversation Management

**Goal:** Start/resume sessions cleanly.
**Tasks:**

* “New conversation” button; optional title auto-generated from first problem.
* Conversation list with timestamps, filters (topic/grade).
* Soft delete/archive.
  **Acceptance Criteria:**
* User can resume where they left off (loads board + turns).
* Title reflects problem content; archive hides from default list.
